    Abstract = {Optimized libraries with callables in Python are very popular for scientific development. They provide an accessible interface, complemented with strong performance. However, there are often operations that these specialized libraries do not support, but are nevertheless necessary in custom applications. This presents a problem, since these unsupported operations are often implemented in Python by the application designer, and therefore are usually unoptimized. Applications that mandate significant performance cannot be effective when they also require these unsupported operations. This performance gap can be greatly reduced with selective embedded just-in-time specialization, or SEJITS. Instead of writing simple Python code for the custom operations, SEJITS allows users to write an optimized version of the routine that can be called in Python. The JIT-specialized code drastically improves performance of the custom routine, allowing the overall computing pipeline for the application to witness a significant speedup. This report explores SKYE, an application that uses OpenCV and a custom SEJITS-optimized method to perform motion detection and tracking.}

    Abstract = {We present a machine learning technique for the algorithm selection problem, specifically focusing on algorithms for dense matrix multiplication. Dense matrix multiplication is a core component of many high-performance computing and machine learning algorithms, but the performance of matrix multiplication algorithms can vary significantly based on input parameters and hardware architecture. We build performance models for multiple machines using support vector machines (SVMs) and show that only a sparse exploration of the input space is sufficient to accurately predict the best choice of algorithm over a wide range of possible inputs. We find that by using this classifier-based approach to choose the best algorithm to use at runtime, we are able to achieve as much as a 26% increase in average performance over choosing a single algorithm a priori. This is within 1.5% of the performance possible with a perfect algorithm selector.}

    Abstract = {Recursion continues to play an important role in high-performance computing. However, parallelizing recursive algorithms while achieving high performance is nontrivial and can result in complex, hard-to-maintain code. In particular, assigning processors to subproblems is complicated by recent observations that communication costs often dominate computation costs. Previous work demonstrates that carefully choosing which divide-and-conquer steps to execute in parallel (breadth-first steps) and which to execute sequentially (depth-first steps) can result in significant performance gains over naive scheduling. Our Framework for Recursive Parallel Algorithms (FRPA) allows for the separation of an algorithm's implementation from its parallelization. The programmer must simply define how to split a problem, solve the base case, and merge solved subproblems; FRPA handles parallelizing the code and tuning the recursive parallelization strategy, enabling algorithms to achieve high performance. To demonstrate FRPA's performance capabilities, we present a detailed analysis of two algorithms: Strassen-Winograd and Communication-Optimal Parallel Recursive Rectangular Matrix Multiplication (CARMA). Our single-precision CARMA implementation is fewer than 80 lines of code and achieves a speedup of up to 11X over Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL) matrix multiplication routine on "skinny" matrices. Our double-precision Strassen-Winograd implementation, at just 150 lines of code, is up to 45% faster than MKL for large square matrix multiplications. To show FRPA's generality and simplicity, we implement six additional algorithms: mergesort, quicksort, TRSM, SYRK, Cholesky decomposition, and Delaunay triangulation. FRPA is implemented in C++, runs in shared-memory environments, uses Intel's Cilk Plus for task-based parallelism, and leverages OpenTuner to tune the parallelization strategy.}

Nevertheless, inferring sound causation between HTTP requests is a challenging task. Previous work often inferred these relationships without proper calibration. We present here methods for and considerations when inferring causation relationships between HTTP requests. We also introduce causation trees and terminology needed to model causal relationships between HTTP requests. Finally, we describe Gretel, our system that infers causation relationships, how we calibrated it, and our results on a sample control data set where ground truth was available.}

    Abstract = {Communication-optimal algorithms are known for square matrix multiplication. Here, we obtain the first communication-optimal algorithm for all dimensions of rectan- gular matrices. Combining the dimension-splitting technique of Frigo, Leiserson, Prokop and Ramachandran (1999) with the recursive BFS/DFS approach of Ballard, Demmel, Holtz, Lipshitz and Schwartz (2012) allows for a communication-optimal as well as cache- and network-oblivious algorithm. Moreover, the implementation is simple: approximately 50 lines of code for the shared-memory version. Since the new algorithm minimizes communication across the network, between NUMA domains, and between levels of cache, it performs well in practice on both shared- and distributed-memory machines. We show significant speedups over existing parallel linear algebra libraries both on a 32-core shared-memory machine and on a distributed-memory supercomputer.}

  abstract = {This research investigates how to introduce synchronous interactive peer learning into an online setting appropriate both for crowdworkers (learning new tasks) and students in massive online courses (learning course material). We present an interaction framework in which groups of learners are formed on demand and then proceed through a sequence of activities that include synchronous group discussion on learner-generated responses. Via controlled experiments with crowdworkers, we show that discussing challenging problems leads to better outcomes than working individually, and incentivizing people to help one another yields still better results. We then show that providing a mini-lesson in which workers consider the principles underlying the tested concept and justify their answers leads to further improvements. Combining the mini-lesson with the discussion of the multiple-choice question leads to significant improvements on that question. We also find positive subjective responses to the peer interactions, suggesting that discussions can improve morale in remote work or learning settings.

   Abstract = {This paper describes our experience in trying to transfer our re-vised software engineering curriculum from UC Berkeley to other universities. We were in the first wave of Massive Open Online Course (MOOCs), and this paper lists the lessons learned about educational technology transfer from developing MOOCs. To make it easier for instructors to use MOOC material, EdX offers Small Private Online Course (SPOCs), a term that we coined.}

While early discussions around the pros and cons of MOOCs have been
spirited, often overlooked in such discussions are how MOOCs can enhance
rather than replace classroom teaching.  Experience with an early and
highly-successful software engineering MOOC led to coining the term
SPOC, for Small Private Online Course, to describe the more intimate
experience resulting from the careful customization and adaptation of
MOOC-tested materials for classroom use.  The result is that the campus
course on which the MOOC was based has quadrupled its enrollment while
maintaining high student evaluations and has allowed teaching assistants
to spend more of their time advising open-ended student projects, which
are key to the course's learning objectives.  Further, a growing
community of classroom instructors at other universities has adapted the
same MOOC materials in a wide variety of pedagogies, dispelling the myth
that MOOCs threaten to impose homogeneity that de-professionalizes
instructors and devalues their creativity.  On the contrary, this SPOC
community now regularly contributes new course materials to the MOOC and
enhances existing ones, to the benefit of all.  Notwithstanding, 
structural and cultural institutional obstacles pose some challenges to
widespread emulation of this successful strategy.}
