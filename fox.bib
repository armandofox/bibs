    Abstract = {Energy efficiency is a growing concern in modern datacenters. As Internet services increasingly rely on MapReduce workloads to fuel their flagship businesses, there is a growing need for better MapReduce energy efficency evaluation mechanisms. We present a statistics-driven workload generation framework that distills summary statistics from production MapReduce traces and realistically reproduces representative workloads. These workloads help us evaluate design decisions with regard to scale, configuration, scheduling, and other issues. We use this framework to identify specific suggestions to improve MapReduce energy efficiency. Our key finding is that evaluations using trace-driven workloads reverse current design priorities in optimizing for data intensive synthetic jobs.}

    Abstract = {A recent trend for data-intensive computations is to use pay-as-you-go execution environments that scale transparently to the user. However, providers of such environments must tackle the challenge of configuring their system to provide maximal performance while minimizing the cost of resources used. In this paper, we use statistical models to predict resource requirements for Cloud computing applications. Such a prediction framework can guide system design and deployment decisions such as scale, scheduling, and capacity. In addition, we present initial design of a workload generator that can be used to evaluate alternative configurations without the overhead of reproducing a real workload. This paper focuses on statistical modeling and its application to data-intensive workloads.}

    Abstract = {We present two novel data structures developed in the SCADS distributed storage toolkit for synchronizing replicated datasets with predictable performance: Nye's trie is a lightweight index for ordered key-value sets that supports synchronization with time and bandwidth utilization proportional to the number of diverging entries. While efficient, this process is only predictable if the number of divergent entries can be measured. For this, we introduce the floret estimator, a novel sublinear-space set summarization structure used to estimate the cardinalities of set difference, union, and intersection operations. We describe how these structures satisfy the design requirements of the SCADS system, detail their design and implementation, and present a set of microbenchmarks demonstrating their functionality.}

    Abstract = {Large-scale, user-facing applications are increasingly moving from relational databases to distributed key-value stores for high request rate, low latency workloads. Often this move is motivated not only by key/value stores’ ability to scale simply by adding more hardware, but also by the easy to understand predictable performance they provide for all operations. For complex queries this approach often requires onerous explicit index management and imperative data lookup by the developer. We propose PIQL, a Performance Insightful Query Language that allows developers to express many of the queries found on these websites, while still providing strict performance guarantees.}

    Abstract = {Optimized libraries with callables in Python are very popular for scientific development. They provide an accessible interface, complemented with strong performance. However, there are often operations that these specialized libraries do not support, but are nevertheless necessary in custom applications. This presents a problem, since these unsupported operations are often implemented in Python by the application designer, and therefore are usually unoptimized. Applications that mandate significant performance cannot be effective when they also require these unsupported operations. This performance gap can be greatly reduced with selective embedded just-in-time specialization, or SEJITS. Instead of writing simple Python code for the custom operations, SEJITS allows users to write an optimized version of the routine that can be called in Python. The JIT-specialized code drastically improves performance of the custom routine, allowing the overall computing pipeline for the application to witness a significant speedup. This report explores SKYE, an application that uses OpenCV and a custom SEJITS-optimized method to perform motion detection and tracking.}

    Abstract = {Today’s “high productivity” programming languages such as Python lack the performance of harder-to-program “efficiency” languages (CUDA, Cilk, C with OpenMP) that can exploit extensive programmer knowledge of parallel hardware architectures.	We combine efficiency-language performance with productivity-language programmability using selective embedded just-in-time specialization (SEJITS). At runtime, we specialize (generate, compile, and execute efficiency-language source code for) an application-specific and platform-specific subset of a productivity language, largely invisibly to the application programmer. Because the specialization machinery is implemented in the productivity language itself, it is easy for efficiency programmers to incrementally add specializers for new domain abstractions, new hardware, or both. SEJITS has the potential to bridge productivity-layer research and efficiency-layer research, allowing domain experts to exploit different parallel hardware architectures with a fraction of the programmer time and effort usually required.}

    Abstract = {We present an interpretation of subdivision surface evaluation in the language of linear algebra. Specifically, the vector of surface points can be computed by left-multiplying the vector of control points by a sparse subdivision matrix. This “matrix-driven” interpretation applies to any level of subdivision, holds for many common subdivision schemes (including Catmull-Clark and Loop), supports limit surface evaluation, allows semi-sharp creases, and complements feature-adaptive optimizations. It is primarily applicable to static meshes undergoing deformation (i.e. animation), in which case the subdivision matrix is invariant over time and the surface can be evaluated at each frame with a single sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV). We describe techniques for building subdivision matrices on-the-fly using the recursive definition of the subdivision scheme and sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpMM) routines. The performance of our approach thus reduces to that of SpMV and SpMM, both of which have been studied extensively and are available in common packages for numerical linear algebra. We implemented our approach as an extension to Pixar’s OpenSubdiv library using routines from Intel’s Math Kernel Library and Nvidia’s CUSPARSE library to target multicore CPUs and GPUs, respectively. We present performance results from off-the-shelf routines and our own “SpMV-like” routines that achieve 1.7-4.8x better performance than existing techniques on both platforms.We conclude by describing two major limitations of matrix-driven evaluation, namely difficulty computing vertex normals and complications in the presence of hierarchical edits, and suggest workarounds for both.}

It is challenging for compiler programmers to debug errors in the compilation because they must perform complicated end-to-end reasoning, relating the programs across the multiple stages of compilation.  To simplify this debugging effort, we present multi-level debugging, a novel combination of error-checking algorithms in a multi-stage compilation environment.  Our method particularly aims to model and check sequential and parallel notions of nondeterminism and related bugs introduced by the compilation.  Using our method, the programmer can systematically eliminate potential sources of the bug in the compilation process and focus only on the real source.  We demonstrated on two real multi-stage compilers the effectiveness of multi-stage debugging in simplifying the diagnosis of manually-injected bugs as well as in an actual bug encountered during compiler development.}

    Abstract = {Provided certain obstacles are overcome, we believe Cloud Computing has the potential to transform a large part of the IT industry, making software even more attractive as a service and shaping the way IT hardware is designed and purchased.  Developers with innovative ideas for new interactive Internet services no longer require the large capital outlays in hardware to deploy their service or the human expense to operate it. They need not be concerned about over-provisioning for a service whose popularity does not meet their predictions, thus wasting costly resources, or under-provisioning for one that becomes wildly popular, thus missing potential customers and revenue. Moreover, companies with large batch-oriented tasks can get their results as quickly as their programs can scale, since using 1000 servers for one hour costs no more than using one server for 1000 hours. This elasticity of resources, without paying a premium for large scale, is unprecedented in the history of IT.  The economies of scale of very large-scale datacenters combined with  ``pay-as-you-go'' resource usage has heralded the rise of Cloud Computing. It is now attractive to deploy an innovative new Internet service on a third party's Internet Datacenter rather than your own infrastructure, and to gracefully scale its resources as it grows or declines in popularity and revenue. Expanding and shrinking daily in response to normal diurnal patterns could lower costs even further. Cloud Computing transfers the risks of over-provisioning or under-provisioning to the Cloud Computing provider, who mitigates that risk by statistical multiplexing over a much larger set of users and who offers relatively low prices due better utilization and from the economy of purchasing at a larger scale. We define terms, present an economic model that quantifies the key buy vs. pay-as-you-go decision, offer a spectrum to classify Cloud Computing providers, and give our view of the top 10 obstacles and opportunities to the growth of Cloud Computing.}

We build performance models for multiple machines using support vector machines (SVMs) and show that only a sparse exploration of the input space is sufficient to accurately predict the best choice of algorithm over a wide range of possible inputs. We find that by using this classifier-based approach to choose the best algorithm to use at runtime, we are able to achieve as much as a 26\% increase in average performance over choosing a single algorithm a priori. This is within 1.5\% of the performance possible with a perfect algorithm selector.}

    Abstract = {Recursion continues to play an important role in high-performance computing. However, parallelizing recursive algorithms while achieving high performance is nontrivial and can result in complex, hard-to-maintain code. In particular, assigning processors to subproblems is complicated by recent observations that communication costs often dominate computation costs. Previous work demonstrates that carefully choosing which divide-and-conquer steps to execute in parallel (breadth-first steps) and which to execute sequentially (depth-first steps) can result in significant performance gains over naive scheduling. Our Framework for Recursive Parallel Algorithms (FRPA) allows for the separation of an algorithm's implementation from its parallelization. The programmer must simply define how to split a problem, solve the base case, and merge solved subproblems; FRPA handles parallelizing the code and tuning the recursive parallelization strategy, enabling algorithms to achieve high performance. To demonstrate FRPA's performance capabilities, we present a detailed analysis of two algorithms: Strassen-Winograd and Communication-Optimal Parallel Recursive Rectangular Matrix Multiplication (CARMA). Our single-precision CARMA implementation is fewer than 80 lines of code and achieves a speedup of up to 11X over Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL) matrix multiplication routine on "skinny" matrices. Our double-precision Strassen-Winograd implementation, at just 150 lines of code, is up to 45\% faster than MKL for large square matrix multiplications. To show FRPA's generality and simplicity, we implement six additional algorithms: mergesort, quicksort, TRSM, SYRK, Cholesky decomposition, and Delaunay triangulation. FRPA is implemented in C++, runs in shared-memory environments, uses Intel's Cilk Plus for task-based parallelism, and leverages OpenTuner to tune the parallelization strategy.}

    Abstract = {Communication-optimal algorithms are known for square matrix multiplication. Here, we obtain the first communication-optimal algorithm for all dimensions of rectan- gular matrices. Combining the dimension-splitting technique of Frigo, Leiserson, Prokop and Ramachandran (1999) with the recursive BFS/DFS approach of Ballard, Demmel, Holtz, Lipshitz and Schwartz (2012) allows for a communication-optimal as well as cache- and network-oblivious algorithm. Moreover, the implementation is simple: approximately 50 lines of code for the shared-memory version. Since the new algorithm minimizes communication across the network, between NUMA domains, and between levels of cache, it performs well in practice on both shared- and distributed-memory machines. We show significant speedups over existing parallel linear algebra libraries both on a 32-core shared-memory machine and on a distributed-memory supercomputer.}

  abstract = {This research investigates how to introduce synchronous interactive peer learning into an online setting appropriate both for crowdworkers (learning new tasks) and students in massive online courses (learning course material). We present an interaction framework in which groups of learners are formed on demand and then proceed through a sequence of activities that include synchronous group discussion on learner-generated responses. Via controlled experiments with crowdworkers, we show that discussing challenging problems leads to better outcomes than working individually, and incentivizing people to help one another yields still better results. We then show that providing a mini-lesson in which workers consider the principles underlying the tested concept and justify their answers leads to further improvements. Combining the mini-lesson with the discussion of the multiple-choice question leads to significant improvements on that question. We also find positive subjective responses to the peer interactions, suggesting that discussions can improve morale in remote work or learning settings.

We present a system that can provide real-time actionable code style feedback to students in large introductory computer science classes. We demonstrate that in a randomized controlled trial, 70% of students using our system achieved the best style solution to a coding problem in less than an hour, while only 13% of students in the control group achieved the same. Students using our system also showed a statistically-significant greater improvement in code style than students in the control group. We also present experiments to demonstrate the efficacy and relevance of each of the different types of hints generated by our system.}

    Abstract = {Project-based courses are widely used in software engineering curricula. In this report, we examine two issues related to project-based software engineering courses: 1) what processes should we include in the course, and 2) in order to achieve formative assessments, how can we build process metrics. In the first part, we combine a field study on professional Agile (eXtreme Programming, XP) teams and an established team process taxonomy to "proactively" select team processes to include in a project-based software engineering course.  We choose processes that are 1) considered essential by professionals, and 2) complete with respect to coverage of the taxonomy's main categories. A case study shows that the augmented course design improves learning outcomes. In the second part, we establish the importance of measuring processes in project-based software engineering courses and present metrics mined from software development tools for monitoring and observing processes to facilitate teaching. A case study confirms that teams with better conformance to software development processes achieve better outcomes. Methods presented in this report can be used to improve software engineering courses. Some future studies are discussed in this report, envisioning a systematic method for improving and automating software engineering courses.}

While early discussions around the pros and cons of MOOCs have been
spirited, often overlooked in such discussions are how MOOCs can enhance
rather than replace classroom teaching.  Experience with an early and
highly-successful software engineering MOOC led to coining the term
SPOC, for Small Private Online Course, to describe the more intimate
experience resulting from the careful customization and adaptation of
MOOC-tested materials for classroom use.  The result is that the campus
course on which the MOOC was based has quadrupled its enrollment while
maintaining high student evaluations and has allowed teaching assistants
to spend more of their time advising open-ended student projects, which
are key to the course's learning objectives.  Further, a growing
community of classroom instructors at other universities has adapted the
same MOOC materials in a wide variety of pedagogies, dispelling the myth
that MOOCs threaten to impose homogeneity that de-professionalizes
instructors and devalues their creativity.  On the contrary, this SPOC
community now regularly contributes new course materials to the MOOC and
enhances existing ones, to the benefit of all.  Notwithstanding, 
structural and cultural institutional obstacles pose some challenges to
widespread emulation of this successful strategy.}

abstract = {Parsons Problems and Faded Parsons Problems have been shown to be effective in helping students in programming courses transition from passive learning, such as lectures or textbooks, to active learning in the form of writing code. We present FPPgen, an authoring system that largely automates the conversion of existing open-ended code-writing exercises to Faded Parsons Problems (FPPs). FPP solutions can be machine-checked using either spec-based autograding, in which student solutions are evaluated against instructor-provided test cases, or mutation-based autograding, in which students produce one or more unit tests that are evaluated using mutation testing. Our system allows creating exercises that rely on complex libraries and helper functions, such as student code intended to be run as part of a complex framework-based application. Our system also gracefully supports cumulative multi-part problems, in which later parts build on earlier parts. Python and Ruby exercises are currently supported, but FPPgen is language-agnostic and adding autograders for other languages is straightforward. In our experience so far, instructors can draft simple questions in less than an hour and mutation-based questions in about two hours as open-ended coding questions, and student helpers can use our tools to convert these to FPPs in less than an hour. FPPgen is in active use in both beginning and advanced large-enrollment programming courses in a CS undergraduate program at a large US university.},
