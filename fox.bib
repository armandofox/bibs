    Abstract = {Communication-optimal algorithms are known for square matrix multiplication. Here, we obtain the first communication-optimal algorithm for all dimensions of rectan- gular matrices. Combining the dimension-splitting technique of Frigo, Leiserson, Prokop and Ramachandran (1999) with the recursive BFS/DFS approach of Ballard, Demmel, Holtz, Lipshitz and Schwartz (2012) allows for a communication-optimal as well as cache- and network-oblivious algorithm. Moreover, the implementation is simple: approximately 50 lines of code for the shared-memory version. Since the new algorithm minimizes communication across the network, between NUMA domains, and between levels of cache, it performs well in practice on both shared- and distributed-memory machines. We show significant speedups over existing parallel linear algebra libraries both on a 32-core shared-memory machine and on a distributed-memory supercomputer.}

  abstract = {This research investigates how to introduce synchronous interactive peer learning into an online setting appropriate both for crowdworkers (learning new tasks) and students in massive online courses (learning course material). We present an interaction framework in which groups of learners are formed on demand and then proceed through a sequence of activities that include synchronous group discussion on learner-generated responses. Via controlled experiments with crowdworkers, we show that discussing challenging problems leads to better outcomes than working individually, and incentivizing people to help one another yields still better results. We then show that providing a mini-lesson in which workers consider the principles underlying the tested concept and justify their answers leads to further improvements. Combining the mini-lesson with the discussion of the multiple-choice question leads to significant improvements on that question. We also find positive subjective responses to the peer interactions, suggesting that discussions can improve morale in remote work or learning settings.
