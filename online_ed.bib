  note = {Differentiating between "routine" and "adaptive" expertise seems to somewhat correlate with SW industry opinion of bootcamps; 100\% of industry participants noted importance of soft/team skills, wherever they are learned, with teawork/communication the most-frequently-cited expectation of new hires (36.8\% frequency in list); degreed students are seen as better at data analysis, algorithmic problem-solving, knowing what techniques to use, but their coding skills (especially style/habits) are seen to be weak; whereas bootcamp grads (who are typically older and more seasoned to begin with, and most have 4-year degrees) are praised for hands-on experience and "practical" problem solving skills. Question: could prof certs with hands-on training for team project be best of both?? }}
