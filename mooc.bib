  abstract = {This research investigates how to introduce synchronous interactive peer learning into an online setting appropriate both for crowdworkers (learning new tasks) and students in massive online courses (learning course material). We present an interaction framework in which groups of learners are formed on demand and then proceed through a sequence of activities that include synchronous group discussion on learner-generated responses. Via controlled experiments with crowdworkers, we show that discussing challenging problems leads to better outcomes than working individually, and incentivizing people to help one another yields still better results. We then show that providing a mini-lesson in which workers consider the principles underlying the tested concept and justify their answers leads to further improvements. Combining the mini-lesson with the discussion of the multiple-choice question leads to significant improvements on that question. We also find positive subjective responses to the peer interactions, suggesting that discussions can improve morale in remote work or learning settings.

While early discussions around the pros and cons of MOOCs have been
spirited, often overlooked in such discussions are how MOOCs can enhance
rather than replace classroom teaching.  Experience with an early and
highly-successful software engineering MOOC led to coining the term
SPOC, for Small Private Online Course, to describe the more intimate
experience resulting from the careful customization and adaptation of
MOOC-tested materials for classroom use.  The result is that the campus
course on which the MOOC was based has quadrupled its enrollment while
maintaining high student evaluations and has allowed teaching assistants
to spend more of their time advising open-ended student projects, which
are key to the course's learning objectives.  Further, a growing
community of classroom instructors at other universities has adapted the
same MOOC materials in a wide variety of pedagogies, dispelling the myth
that MOOCs threaten to impose homogeneity that de-professionalizes
instructors and devalues their creativity.  On the contrary, this SPOC
community now regularly contributes new course materials to the MOOC and
enhances existing ones, to the benefit of all.  Notwithstanding, 
structural and cultural institutional obstacles pose some challenges to
widespread emulation of this successful strategy.}
