    abstract = { Current instructional reforms in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses have focused on enhancing adoption of evidence-based instructional practices among STEM faculty members. These practices have been empirically demonstrated to enhance student learning and attitudes. However, research indicates that instructors often adapt rather than adopt practices, unknowingly compromising their effectiveness. Thus, there is a need to raise awareness of the research-based implementation of these practices, develop fidelity of implementation protocols to understand adaptations being made, and ultimately characterize the true impact of reform efforts based on these practices. Peer instruction (PI) is an example of an evidence-based instructional practice that consists of asking students conceptual questions during class time and collecting their answers via clickers or response cards. Extensive research has been conducted by physics and biology education researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of this practice and to better understand the intricacies of its implementation. PI has also been investigated in other disciplines, such as chemistry and computer science. This article reviews and summarizes these various bodies of research and provides instructors and researchers with a research-based model for the effective implementation of PI. Limitations of current studies and recommendations for future empirical inquiries are also provided. }

The need to adequately cover the content domain to certify achievement proficiency by producing meaningful precise scores requires many high-quality items. More 3-option items can be administered than 4- or 5-option items per testing time while improving content coverage, without detrimental effects on psychometric quality of test scores. Researchers have endorsed 3-option items for over 80 years with empirical evidence—the results of which have been synthesized in an effort to unify this endorsement and encourage its adoption.},

abstract = {This study reports on the perceived capacity of coding boot camps versus computer science (CS) undergraduate programs to instill a range of software development skills from an industry perspective. We present findings from a series of national focus groups and individual interviews with representatives from the software development industry, who spoke about their hiring procedures and preferences as well as how they perceived coding boot camp applicants in comparison to graduates from four-year CS degree programs. We also present findings on how the boot camp and university participants viewed their role in developing necessary skills for employability. Results indicate that hiring managers filling positions, generally have a favorable perspective of coding boot camp hires in relation to their demonstration of "soft" skills, such as teamwork, passion, and persistence; With regards to four-year university hires, several industry representatives indicated that a four-year degree is mandatory for hire, while also listing a solid understanding of CS principles and substantial exposure to mathematics. The Discussion section focuses on the future potential of coding boot camps as an alternative training ground for the software development industry.},
